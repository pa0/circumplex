44 citations

This paper evaluates psychometric criteria for assessing circumplex structure in psychological measurement models.
- Evaluated 10 psychometric criteria (6 existing and 4 new) for their ability to detect circumplex structure
- Used simulations to test the performance of the criteria in detecting equal/unequal axes and interstitiality/simple structure
- Identified 5 criteria that were ineffective at detecting circumplex structure
- Tested a "deviation scoring" approach to improve the effectiveness of the psychometric criteria

This paper describes methods for integrating circular statistics and structural summary analysis to optimize the description and comparison of groups using circumplex-based assessment instruments, but does not compare the psychometric properties of different measurement tools.
- Using circular statistics to analyze group-level data on circumplex-based assessment instruments, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and group comparisons
- Using the structural summary method to provide complementary information on the interpersonal prototypicality, differentiation, and elevation of group profiles
- Demonstrating how using these two methods together provides more comprehensive information than either one alone

The Interpersonal Adjective Scales demonstrate excellent fit to the circumplex model of personality.
- Used the Interpersonal Adjective Scales (IAS) to assess interpersonal traits
- Examined the fit of the IAS to the circumplex model of personality from multiple perspectives
- Tested different versions of the circumplex model and applied different methods to evaluate the fit
- Found that the IAS had an excellent fit to the structural requirements of the circumplex model, with negligible departures
